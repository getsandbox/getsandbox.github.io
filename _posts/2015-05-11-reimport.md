### Re-import

This month's platform update brings support for re-importing an API definition into an existing Sandbox. A number of people have asked to be able to re-import an API definition (like Swagger, Apiary or WSDL) to support their workflow better as their API changes over time. The first version of this is now available.

The first version of this feature works as a destructive re-import, re-importing a new version of your API definition will clobber any changes you have made since your initial Sandbox creation. This doesn't suit everyone's use case, obviously only supporting those who make few changes to their generated definition and are will to migrate them manually. We realise this and are already planning the next revision where the re-import process will combine the new API imported definition with any changes you have made to enhance the function of your Sandbox with the since the last import, but that is obviously a much more complicated undertaking.

There are a number of other minor updates and tweaks that have gone on this month, the most noticable of which is cleaning up some whitespace / newline artifacts left behind by the liquid templating process. Previously liquid tags would leave behind any whitespace that surrounded them, potentially leaving many ugly empty lines in your final output, these new lines are now automatically removed and your responses should be much cleaner.
