### Docs!

Second round of documentation updates are in, more tweaks to request handling , supported libraries and the more details about the JMS implementation for the Sandbox Server deployments.

Recent additions for this week:

[JMS Request Handling](https://getsandbox.com/docs/jms-request-handling), a new addition to the platform (server only) is JMS support, so you can build Sandboxes across both HTTP and JMS transports, ActiveMQ and Websphere MQ support to start with.

[Supported 3rd party JavaScript libraries available out-of-the box](https://getsandbox.com/docs/js-libraries), extended the list to cover the new versions of 3rd party libraries we support. All new Sandboxes created after the go-live date for this feature will be referencing this new set of library versions.

Also tweaks to existing entries. Expect more updates soon!
