### REST API

The first version of our API for the Sandbox and Activity resources is now public! We have had an unofficial / unsupported API for more than 2 years as some eager users have discovered, but as of now the first version of our API is now public and supported.

The API covers operations across both the Sandbox and Activity resources, most importantly the Activity search operation is part of the API, which is required for external test assertions (available through both the [API](https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview) and the [upcoming Java SDK](github.com/getsandbox/java-sdk))

The API documentation including interface specification and examples is available [here](https://getsandbox.com/docs/api/overview), we have a task on our backlog to write tutorials showing how to use the API, so you should see those soon!
